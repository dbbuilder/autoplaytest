### Key Components

#### 1. Simple Runner (`src/simple_runner.py`)
- One-line execution: `await run_test_suite(url, username, password)`
- Two-part execution: `generate_test_scripts()` + `execute_test_scripts()`
- Command-line interface with full argument support
- Configuration file support (YAML/JSON)

#### 2. Main Engine (`src/core/engine/main_engine.py`)
- Orchestrates the entire testing process
- Manages script generation, execution, and reporting
- Supports both execution workflows
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 3. Test Executor (`src/core/executor/test_executor.py`)
- Executes Playwright scripts with monitoring
- Injects performance tracking and error detection
- Captures screenshots, videos, and logs
- Supports both file-based and code-based execution

#### 4. Generated Scripts Include
- Standalone `run_tests.py` for independent execution
- Complete monitoring and performance tracking
- Error handling and logging
- Screenshot and video capture
- System resource monitoring

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### One-Line Execution
```python
from src.simple_runner import run_test_suite

results = await run_test_suite(
    url="https://your-app.com",
    username="user",
    password="pass",
    browser="chromium",
    headless=True
)
```

### Two-Part Execution
```python
from src.simple_runner import generate_test_scripts, execute_test_scripts

# Generate scripts
scripts_path = await generate_test_scripts(
    url="https://your-app.com",
    username="user",
    password="pass",
    output_dir="./my_tests"
)

# Execute later (possibly with different config)
results = await execute_test_scripts(
    scripts_path,
    execution_config={"browser": "firefox", "headless": True}
)
```

### Command Line
```bash
# One-line execution
python src/simple_runner.py --url https://app.com --username user --password pass --mode one-line

# Two-part execution
python src/simple_runner.py --url https://app.com --username user --password pass --mode generate --output-dir ./tests
python src/simple_runner.py --mode execute --scripts-dir ./tests
```
