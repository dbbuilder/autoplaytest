        try:
            await page.goto("https://www.saucedemo.com")
            await expect(page).to_have_title("Swag Labs")
            await page.fill("input[name='user-name']", "standard_user")
            await page.fill("input[name='password']", "secret_sauce")
            await page.click("input[name='login-button']")
            await expect(page).to_have_url("https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html")
        finally:
            await browser.close()
```

- **Results**:
  - Tests Generated: 4
  - Tests Passed: 4/4 (100%)
  - Notable: Navigation test took 34.45s (complex site)
  - Total Time: ~84s (generation) + ~160s (execution)

**Sample Search Test Generated**:
```python
async def test_search_functionality():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        context = await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()
        
        try:
            await page.goto("https://automationexercise.com")
            await page.fill("input[name='search']", "dress")
            await page.press("input[name='search']", "Enter")
            await expect(page).to_have_url("https://automationexercise.com/products?search=dress")
        finally:
            await browser.close()
```

## Key Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. **Intelligent Test Generation**
- AI analyzes page structure and generates contextually appropriate tests
- Tests include proper assertions and error handling
- Generated code follows Playwright best practices

### 2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- Login functionality with form filling
- Navigation between pages
- Form interactions and validation
- Search functionality
- Proper page load waiting and assertions

### 3. **Robust Execution**
- Tests run with pytest integration
- Performance metrics captured for each test
- Proper cleanup with try/finally blocks
- Session management for authenticated testing

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of timeouts
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Continues testing other sites even if one fails

## Performance Analysis

| Site | Generation Time | Execution Time | Total Tests | Success Rate |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| SauceDemo | ~44s | ~31s | 3 | 100% |
| The Internet | ~44s | ~23s | 2 | 100% |
| ReqRes | Failed | N/A | 0 | N/A |
| Automation Exercise | ~84s | ~160s | 4 | 100% |

**Total**: 9 tests generated and executed successfully across 3 sites

## Technical Achievements

1. **Fixed Issues**:
   - Empty script generation (added GPT prompt template)
   - Provider selection (dynamic provider switching)
   - Test execution implementation (_execute_with_monitoring)
   - Manifest format handling (supports list and dict)

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Successfully using GPT-4 for test generation
   - Proper prompt engineering for quality output
   - Code extraction from AI responses

3. **Execution Pipeline**:
   - Subprocess execution with pytest
   - JSON report parsing
   - Performance metric collection
   - Console output capture

## Recommendations

1. **For ReqRes timeout issue**:
   - Implement retry logic for page loading
   - Add configurable timeout per site
   - Consider alternative wait strategies

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache AI responses for similar pages
   - Parallel test generation for multiple test types
   - Optimize browser context reuse

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add visual regression testing
   - Implement cross-browser testing
   - Add test result visualization

## Conclusion

The AI Playwright Testing Engine successfully demonstrates its ability to:
- Generate high-quality Playwright tests using AI
- Execute tests reliably with proper monitoring
- Handle various types of web applications
